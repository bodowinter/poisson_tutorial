# Readme

This repository contains all materials to go along with Winter & Bürkner (2021), "Poisson regression for linguists:
A tutorial introduction to modeling count data with brms".

There are three files:

- **gesture.Rmd** : main markdown with follow-along tutorial
- **gesture.html** : knitted markdown
- **dyads.csv** : gesture data from Brown, Kim, Hübscher, and Winter (in press, Gesture)

To follow the tutorial, we recommend downloading the entire repository and unzipping the folder.
